🟦 Obstacle Avoiding Robot with Voice & Bluetooth Control

📌 Introduction

An obstacle-avoiding robot with voice and Bluetooth control is an intelligent mobile robotic system capable of both autonomous navigation and manual user control.
The robot uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to scan different angles and detect obstacles accurately. This scanning mechanism improves navigation decisions and prevents collisions.

For manual operation, the robot integrates an HC-05 Bluetooth module, allowing control through a smartphone app. Using a Bluetooth controller or voice-to-text app, the user can send commands such as:

Forward

Backward

Left / Right

Stop


The dual-mode design makes the robot versatile, interactive, and ideal for learning concepts related to embedded systems, real-time control, and robotics.
